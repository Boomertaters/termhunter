Experimental Nextbot + Base
Allows for very complicated custom behaviour.
For basing NPCs off this, it doesn't support custom animations that well, it expects player animations by default, but there is limited support for other methods.

Best for creating code-driven AI agents that relentlessly pursue their enemies, crouching, jumping, attacking obstacles.
Supports optimized custom weights on pathfinding, good if you want a bot to avoid a dangerous area, avoid an obvious entrance to a room, etc.
Limited but functional support for custom, non-player shaped enemies, would not recommend working with this base if you've just finished a custom non-player model and want it to attack you.
